# coding-test-prep
Preparing from entry level Software Engineering roles through intensive LeetCode preparation.

The goal is to recognize common patterns in LeetCode problems, as well as to explain the coding concepts. Such concepts include arrays, hashing, strings, sliding window, and binary search.

Completing this set of Leetcode problems will ensure that I am ready for on-site interviews. 

Before 2026, I hope to complete these following LeetCode problems:

1. Two Sum
2. Valid Anagram
3. Contains Duplicate
4. Group Anagrams
5. Product of Array Except Self
6. Top K Frequent Elements
7. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
8. Valid Palindrome
9. Valid Parentheses
10. Longest Common Prefix (super common in JPM)
11. Reverse String
12. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
13. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
14. Permutation in String
15. Binary Search
16. Search Insert Position
17. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
18. Find Peak Element
